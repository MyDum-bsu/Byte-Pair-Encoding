1. Children of the Next Level

In trans-human state
It's time to evacuate
Waiting for a ride to take them to the gate
Await the siren call
More phenobarbital
Pour it down the hatch, ingest it all

Children of the next level
They're chillin' with the Devil
Children of the next level
Here they come!

A new life for an old life
A new form of religion
The final task will reinforce their faith
Immortality
Is it really worth living?
Gather up the children going to the gate

Break through Heaven's Gate
Freedom from this broken world
This mortal shell they leave
Ride up to the sky
Climb aboard and take a trip
To your final destiny

Finished with education
So primitive this creation
It's time to go now no time to waste
They want to see it through
No plan to procrastinate
The mind and soul will elevate you

So now the time has come for T. I. to appear
The book of knowledge taught, predicted the end is near

Ride the comet all dressed in black
Exit earth, there's no turning back
Who holds the key to open Heaven's Gate?
They gave their lives just to escape
Thirty-nine who took the ride
San Diego mass suicide
Who holds the key to open Heaven's Gate?
And take 'em to the next level

Break through Heaven's Gate
Freedom from this broken world

This mortal shell they leave
Ride up to the sky
Climb aboard and take a trip
To your final destiny

So now the time has come for T. I. to appear
The book of knowledge taught, predicted the end is near

Ride the comet all dressed in black
Exit Earth, there's no turning back
Thirty-nine who took the ride
The Children of the Devil

Break through Heaven's Gate
Freedom from this broken world
This mortal shell they leave
Ride up to the sky
Climb aboard and take a trip
To your final destiny


2. WWIII

Device of doom, pure savagery
A holocaust on land or sea
On blighted land these lords of war shall roam
Dictator's oath, his destiny
Destroyer of humanity
Launch an assault that the world has never seen

Nuclear warhead, dropping on the masses
Leaving them all dead before they reach the underground

Seeking out the shelter

Mushroom cloud last thing they see
Vision blurred, their eyeballs bleed
Brutality fuels the death machine
Organs fail, the blood shall seep
Open sores beyond belief
Slowly rot as you die from the inside out

Nuclear warhead, dropping on the masses
Leaving them all dead before they reach the underground
Turning the streets red everything's turned to ashes
Welcome to World War Three

Everyone is gonna die
There is no escape
Your lungs turning black
No one can save you
It's Armageddon!

All hope is lost
The earth's been blown away
It's pouring down
Unholy acid rain
Forever raining blood
Forever blot the sun
Depraved, no sign of life
In darkness, devoid of light

Nuclear warhead, dropping on the masses
Leaving them all dead before they reach the underground
Turning the streets red everything's turned to ashes
The war of the world
There is no more world
Welcome to World War Three

World burning down
Beyond the dark side
Nobody here left to live
World burning down
Beyond the dark side
We'll all be burning in Hell
World burning down
Beyond the dark side
Nobody here left to live
World burning down
Beyond the dark side
We'll all be burning in Hell


3. Dream Deceiver

Every night becomes a nightmare
Nowhere left to escape
She grips my soul and takes control
From which I can't awake
Tormented thoughts are clouding my mind
Won't you leave me alone
Yet every night, when I close my eyes
Still the wicked roam

Dream deceiver
She haunts my dreams all through the night
Dream deceiver

Visions always forming, haunting
Right before my eyes
The demon song is always playing
Calling out my name
Evil thoughts are covering my eyes
See her come and go
Late at night when I hear her cry
I spill some tears of my own

Dream deceiver
She haunts my dreams all through the night
Dream deceiver
And when you're done with me, good night!

Another night in a living nightmare
Nowhere to escape
She rips my soul and takes control
Even when I'm awake
Tormented thoughts are seen through my eyes
See them come and go
Twisted thoughts are clouding my mind
Please just let me go

Dream deceiver
She won't stop haunting me at night
Dream deceiver
She's never done with me, all night


4. Night of the Witch

Lurking in the darkness they consecrate nightfall
A sacred rite destroys the light from purity withdrawn
Behold the face of terror
Open the gates of Hell
The season of the witch
Hell's cast its deadly spell

All night
They cast a spell by the light of the moon

Hiding in the shadows to penetrate your soul
Plant the seed of Blasphemy to tear apart your mind
Spread the wings of terror
May all the curses bind
They now control your wretched soul
A curse upon mankind

Behold the Devil's sign
Beware of witches in the sky
Who is ready to fly?
Unleash Hell

All night
They cast a spell by the light of the moon

Conjuring in darkness, desecrate their will
The dead of night has taken flight, assassinate them all
Show them the face of terror
Show them the grace of Hell
Black magic of the witch
Shall never break the spell

Conjuring with power
Mystical and formless

Behold the Devil's pride
Beware of witches in the sky
Who is ready to die?
You're hell-bound

All night
They cast a spell so the demons will rise

Chanting in the moonlight to dominate your will
Coven flight, they ride the night, exterminate them all
Behold the face of terror
Unlock the gates of Hell
The circle of the witch
You'll never break the spell

Forever now spellbound
Unleash the deadly forces

Behold the Devil's sign
Beware of witches in the sky
Who is ready to fly?
Unleash Hell

All night
They cast a spell so the demons will rise

All night
They cast a spell by the light of the moon


5. City of Angels

Sadist without reason
A pervert for all seasons
The headlines scream, hear them roar

Sanctified by the crimson
By a diabolical drifter
The Night Stalker prowls to hunt you down
Who is this evil slayer?
Death Valley perpetrator
When you say goodnight, beware of the dark

City of Angels
Servant of Satan
Beware of the beast, tonight he calls
Servant of Satan
City of Angels
Beware of the beast when he comes

Los Angeles taunted by America's Most Wanted
This merciless killer comes to claim his prize
Home invasion terror
And it feels just like forever
1985
He's got you in his sights

Frenzied mutilation
A morbid celebration
Nocturnal hunt for the taste of blood

Frenzied mutilation
A morbid celebration
Nocturnal hunt for the taste of blood

Metropolitan bloodbath
Is the L.A.P.D.'s shame
All the locks and doors are bolted down
A rising death toll
Beware and now behold
The mark of evil is painted red

Frenzied mutilation
A morbid celebration
Nocturnal hunt for the taste of blood


6. Ishtar's Gate

A goddess of both love and war
The lion and the star
Safe behind the golden gates
Protection from this world

Queen of the underworld
Long may she reign
Queen of nocturnal wars
Obey
You've gotta hold on
It won't be long
A kingdom without a crown
Blood stains the walls of Babylon

Protected by the demigods
The Dragon and the Bull
Symbolic of aggressive forces
Lock the golden eight

Queen of the underworld
Long may she reign
Queen of nocturnal wars
Obey
You've gotta hold on
It won't be long
A king without his throne
Blood stained the walls of Babylon

A kingdom built to last forever
Purify the blood of the slaves
For Ishtar's Gate

Queen of the underworld
Long may she reign
Queen of nocturnal wars
Obey
You've gotta hold on
It won't be long
A kingdom without a crown
Eight gates protecting Babylon

Trapped between these eyes
Mistrust, no compromise

Extricate your mind
Unchain the ties that bind you
Cover up your tracks
When the world is on your back
It's time to arise
Analyze words of the wise
Realize it's not your fault
When emotion launches its assault

False accusations
Make it impossible

8. False Prophet

So let's begin one by one
First the old then the next were the young
Barley kept alive
Loving mother, father and child
Locked in a rotten cell
A living hell
Left there without remorse
When you speak to your God does he care?

Summoned in one by one
Summoned in to die
Shown to a shallow grave
They were bound, gagged and tied
Nobody left to tell
This curse befell
Left dead without a prayer
When you reach for your God is he there?

I'll give you what you need
Come follow me and see
I'll bring eternity
From my gun to your head I'll play God
You're now a piece of me
Chosen by the one and only
In the name of Jesus Christ
With my hand and a lie take your life

No more pain
Chosen by the one and only
Receive a piece of me
No more pain
Take me by the hand
And follow me and see

Hey now! Please tell me you believe
He uses mind control to make it seem so real
Pray now! Leads a sermon with a gun
So let the truth be told, you're not the chosen one
Bow down! A father and his son
They said their last goodbyes with nothing but love
Hey now! The time has finally come
Take a blow to the head with a bullet from the gun

Hey now! Come follow me and see
When using mind control to get all that he needs
Hey now! Leads a sermon with a gun
So let the truth be known you're not the chosen one


9. The Healers

Seems like yesterday
Life would never be the same
There's nothing you can do
About the sickness in you

Behold a man of principle
Paint me invincible
My sacred feather I shall use
Believe the unpredictable
A native miracle
Close your eyes and see what I can do

Can you hear the howling wolves
Singing their sacred songs
Their music carries in the wind
A holy hand for healing
Will be receiving
A message how this journey ends

The force of a feather
As we battle together yeah?
The force of mother earth
Brings power rebirth yeah?

Take me to the mountaintop
See a man for what he's got
If the wolves will let you pass through
We use the earth for energy
As far as I can reach
My healing powers crystal blue

The force of a feather
As we battle together
The force of rebirth
Will make you one with mother earth yeah?
Yeah yeah

My spirit guides the wind
It brings the message that I need
A blessing from the land
Is what Lupan has brought to me
Go?

The force of a feather
As we battle together yeah?
The force of mother earth
Brings power rebirth yeah?

My spirit guides the wind
It brings the medicine that I need
A blessing from the earth
Is how the healers set me free


10. Code of Hammurabi

Life, death to live by the code
Ancient tales are the stories told
We must enforce Babylonian code of the law
Rise, fall, the lines been drawn
Civilization at the break of dawn
They take control of the chaos that they know

Eye for an eye for an eye
This is the code that I speak
Eye for an eye for an eye
The strong will not injure the weak

Fight, flight, start to unfold
Need to identify friend or foe
Your inner strength is the only way to survive
Black, white, the price of gold
Human lives being bought and sold
Destroying minds and the innocence of life

Eye for an eye for an eye
Live by the code that we keep
Eye for an eye for an eye
The shepherd will gather his sheep

Right, wrong show your proof
The consequence is a tooth for a tooth
Don't be a thief or you'll pay the price with your hand
Young, old you die by the code
What you reap is what you shall sow
Commit a crime and you'll feel the force of the law

Eye for an eye for an eye
This is the code that I speak
Eye for an eye for an eye
The strong will not injure the weak
Eye for an eye for an eye
Live by the code that we keep
Eye for an eye for an eye
The shepherd will gather his sheep


11. Curse of Osiris

Osiris was murdered, by his brother Set
A pharaoh dethroned, brought back from the dead
Now Isis gave birth to their begotten son
Horus will train to avenge his father's death

Lord of Death within the afterlife
Protector of the underworld

Judgment shall pass upon the damned
Egypt cannot be saved
Undying beliefs corrupting the truth
Composed are the lies of the king

Lord of Death within the afterlife
Protector of the underworld

All shall bathe in the pain
No deceiver shall remain
Soon his uncle will die
Horus has taken his throne

Bring Forth Death
Horus has risen and taken his revenge
Bring Forth Death
Destined to kill and avenge his father's death

Lord of Death within the afterlife
Protector of the underworld

Unleashed the curse uncoils twisting like the snake
Victim of Regicide a brother meets his fate
Now from the other side forever shall he rest
Betrayed by his blood a blessing and his curse
